Isnâ€™t all typeface design geometric? Letters are usually a mixture of straight lines and curves and angles. The genre or classification we call geometric sans-serifs are called that because the forms so closely resemble pure geometric shapes: circles and rectangles and sometimes triangles. Geometric typefaces are a century-old innovation, coming out of the [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) movement in the 1920s.
